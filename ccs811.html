	<p>This node reads and manages the AMS / Sciosense CCS811 airquality sensor</p>
	<h3>Node configuration</h3>
	<p><code>i2cBus</code> defines the Number of i2c-Bus you want to use. Caution: This sensor uses so called clock-stretching. Raspberry PI does not support this. To use this sensor you have to
	reduce baud-rate of i2c Interface to 10.000 bauds. To do so add <code>dtparam=i2c_baudrate=10000</code> in /boot/config.txt. Raspberry PI 4 allows to use software defined i2c-Bus. It is said
	that this one supports clock-stretching. If you have other devices needing high speed i2c-Bus this may be an option for you. Of course i2c must be generally enabled in raspi-config or via <code>dtparam=i2c_arm=on</code> in /boot/config.txt</p>
	<p><b><u>Warning</u></b>: Sensor may work without reducing interface baud rate, but it looks like it stopped working all of a sudden. So please ensure you've reduced baud-rate.</p>
<p> CCS811 address is either 0x5A or 0x5B. Find out via <code>i2cdetect -y 1</code>. If command can't be found, install via <code>sudo apt-get install i2c-tools</code>. 
	<p> The sensor has 4 measurment modes, quite self-explaining. However mode which provides every 250ms a new measurement only gives you raw data at this rate. According to datasheet only in mode 1-3 TVOC and eCO2 
		are calculated for every sample. At which rate TVOC and eCO2 are calculated at mode 4 isn't described in manual. It is also not described how to get from raw data to TVOC and eCO2 values.</p>
		<p> When changing mode from higher to lower sample rate sensor should be in idle / off mode for at least 10 minutes. Using a mode with a higher sample rate doesn't require wait time.</p>
		<p> The baseline calibration value should be saved for every mode seperately.</p>
		<p> My recommendation is taking a measurement every 10s or every 60s. This saves energy but gives a reasonable time resolution in measurement.</p>

    <h3>Details</h3>
	<p><code>msg.payload</code> contains the commands you want to send to CCS811-airquality-sensor.</p>
	<p> Use these commands: </p>
	<p><code>getMeasurement</code> Returns the environment data. This command also initializes sensor and sets it into desired mode, if not already.</p> <p>eCO2 and TVOC are quite self-explaining. The other values are just for information and can be interpreted with the datasheet.
	<p><code>getCalibrationBaseline</code> Returns the calibration baseline as Buffer object. Baseline should be saved for each sensor mode individually. During the first 500 hours
	it should be saved every 24 - 48 hours, afterwards every 5 - 7 days. </p>
	<p><code>setCalibrationBaseline</code> in <code>msg.payload</code> together with <code>msg.CalibrationBaseline</code> sets the calibration baseline. According to datasheet this should be done after sensor is already running 
		20 - 30 minutes in desired mode. In my tests it could be already done a few seconds after setting desired mode. However it still takes about 20 minutes until readings are quite accurate. You should check if calibration 
	 baseline is really the one you set. If not it either takes still some time until sensor has heated up completely or air quality differs too much compared to the air quality when saving baseline. </p>
	<p><code>getFWVersions</code> Returns the Bootloader firmware version and App firmware version of your CCS811 sensor.</p>
	<p><code>setEnvironmentCalibration</code> Send together with <code>msg.Humidity</code> (relative humidity as number, so 40% gets 40) and <code>msg.Temperature</code> in Â°C to compensate environment changes. In my tests temperature 
	changed resistance of sensor most. Humidity neglible, but for TVOC and eCO2 calculation mechanism humidty is very important. </p>
	<p><code>getErrorRegister</code> Returns the output of error register.</p>
	<p><code>reset</code> Resets the sensor. Useful to circumvent the automatic baseline calibration during 24 hours.
	
	<h3>Additional information</h3>
	<p>Some notes on baseline calibration. As stated in the datasheet there is an automatic baseline correction / calibration with standard interval of 24 hours. This means sensors
		considers the lowest measured TVOC value within 24 hours as 0 TVOC / 400 ppm eCO2. You regularly won't reach thus good air quality. See below.</p>
		<p>This interval is stated to be programmable, but 
		no information could be found how to change this interval. So as workaround I recommend setting the baseline in regular intervals like every hour. If you want to have a defined time, reset the sensor every 24 hours
		and set the baseline again after initializing / first taken measurement. Since the sensor has already warmed up, there should be no wait time. And remember to calibrate it with really fresh air from time to time.</p>
		<p>Baseline is also calibrated on powerup 
		by setting it to 0 TVOC / 400 ppm eCO2. So if you power up in bad air quality then you get completely wrong readings. Thats why you should calibrate it with fresh air. If you take it outside, please 
		also calibrate environment data temperature and humidity. Then store the calibration baseline and re-set it after powering it up inside. As measurements with a CO2 sensor showed it can take
		hours until there is really a CO2 level of 400 ppm. In winter you'll lose a lot of energy. And temperature and humidity drop a lot, so there is also calibration required for these values.</p>
		<p>
		There is also an automatic baseline correction when the sensor reaches its maximum dynamic range. If it gets to its maxmium of TVOC of 1187 / 8192 ppm eCO2 (Version 2 of the sensor seems to have a higher range) baseline is adjusted that sensor gets
		below these maximum values. There is no clipping! This means without having the same calibration baseline you can't compare these values. </p>
		<p>Especially when testing the sensor by holding an open permanent marker
		near the sensor baseline gets shifted within seconds. 
		To get a comparable value you could use sensor resistance as more reliable value regarding TVOC concentration when exceeding dynamic range. The more TVOC in the air the lower the resistance.
		However this value changes over time, see also baseline calibration. 
		And TVOC and eCO2 values depend not only on sensor resistance (which changes a lot with temperature) but also on humidity and of course temperature. According to datasheet sensor resistance is devided 
		by the baseline. However in my tests values from baseline register didn't have a linear relationship between sensor resistance and TVOC value read from CCS811. </p>
		<p>In most cases dynamic range should be sufficient unless there is a massive amount of TVOC like from a permanent marker or certain household cleaners or benzine. </p>
		<p>If there is any new information about this, node will be updated.
